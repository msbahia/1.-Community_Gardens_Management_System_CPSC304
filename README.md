# PROJECT SUMMARY

Our project operates in the domain of urban planning, food security, sustainability and community engagement. It aims to support the planning and management of urban community gardens, catering to community garden managers, individual gardeners, and suppliers. The main uses of our database are to connect urban gardeners with available community garden spaces, enable gardening in areas with environmental limitations, and offer plant recommendations based on those limitations.
